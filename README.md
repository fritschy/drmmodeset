Example code to use DRM KMS mode with dumbbuffer

The drmmodeset.c example is a short tutorial how to use the DRM mode-setting
API. It describes the concept of connectors, CRTCs, encoders and
framebuffers and shows how to make use of them in simple
graphics-applications.

It is targeted at users with no prior understandings of the DRM system and
is a requirement for understanding any more complex DRM tutorials.

This application is developed for targetting Qualcomm Snapdragon 600 series
board IFC6410 but can be run on any machine whose kernel support DRM modesetting.
